        Max memory to use in each batch (e.g. 100MB, 1GB)

    neighbors_matrix: numpy.ndarray (n_channels, n_channels)
        Boolean numpy 2-D array where a i, j entry is True if i is considered
        neighbor of j

    spike_size: int
        Spike size

    minimum_half_waveform_size: int
        This is used to remove spikes that are either at the beginning or end
        of the recordings and whose location does not allow to draw a
        wavefor of size at least 2 * minimum_half_waveform_size + 1

    threshold: float
        Threshold used on amplitude for detection

    output_path: str, optional
        Directory to save spike indexes, if None, results won't be stored, but
        only returned by the function

    save_spike_index_clear: str, optional
        Whether to save spike_index_clear, it is used as the filename for the
        file (relative to output_path), if None, results won't be saved, only
        returned

    save_spike_index_collision: str, optional
        Whether to save spike_index_collision, it is used as the filename for

    if_file_exists:
        What to do if there is already a file in save_spike_index_clear
        or save_spike_index_collision lcoation. One of 'overwrite', 'abort',
        'skip'. If 'overwrite' it replaces the file if it exists, if 'abort'
        if raise a ValueErrorexception if the file exists, if 'skip' it skips
        the operation if save_spike_index_clear and save_spike_index_collision
        the file exist and loads them from disk, if any of the files is
        missing they are computed

    -------
    spike_index_clear: numpy.ndarray (n_clear_spikes, 2)
        2D array with indexes for clear spikes, first column contains the
