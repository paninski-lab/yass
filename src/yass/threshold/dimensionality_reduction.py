    """Apply PCA in batches

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_to_data: str
        Path to recordings in binary format

    dtype: str
        Recordings dtype

    n_channels: int
        Number of channels in the recordings

    data_order: str
        Recordings order, one of ('channels', 'samples'). In a dataset with k
        observations per channel and j channels: 'channels' means first k
        contiguous observations come from channel 0, then channel 1, and so
        on. 'sample' means first j contiguous data are the first observations
        from all channels, then the second observations from all channels and
        so on

    spike_index: numpy.ndarray
        A 2D numpy array, first column is spike time, second column is main
        channel (the channel where spike has the biggest amplitude)

    spike_size: int
        Spike size

    temporal_features: numpy.ndarray
        Number of output features

    neighbors_matrix: numpy.ndarray (n_channels, n_channels)
        Boolean numpy 2-D array where a i, j entry is True if i is considered
        neighbor of j

    channel_index: np.array (n_channels, n_neigh)
        Each row indexes its neighboring channels.
        For example, channel_index[c] is the index of
        neighboring channels (including itself)
        If any value is equal to n_channels, it is nothing but
        a space holder in a case that a channel has less than
        n_neigh neighboring channels


    max_memory:
        Max memory to use in each batch (e.g. 100MB, 1GB)

    output_path: str, optional
        Directory to store the scores and rotation matrix, if None, previous
        results on disk are ignored, operations are computed and results
        aren't saved to disk

    scores_filename: str, optional
        File name for rotation matrix if False, does not save data

    rotation_matrix_filename: str, optional
        File name for scores if False, does not save data

    spike_index_clear_filename: str, optional
        File name for spike index clear

    if_file_exists:
        What to do if there is already a file in the rotation matrix and/or
        scores location. One of 'overwrite', 'abort', 'skip'. If 'overwrite'
        it replaces the file if it exists, if 'abort' if raise a ValueError
        exception if the file exists, if 'skip' if skips the operation if the
        file exists

    Returns
    -------
    scores: numpy.ndarray
        Numpy 3D array  of size (n_waveforms, n_reduced_features,
        n_neighboring_channels) Scores for every waveform, second dimension in
        the array is reduced from n_temporal_features to n_reduced_features,
        third dimension depends on the number of  neighboring channels

    rotation_matrix: numpy.ndarray
