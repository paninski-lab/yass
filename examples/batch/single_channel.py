# there are two ways of traversing the data: single_channel and multi_channel
# single_channel means that the data in a single batch comes from only one
# channel, multi_channel means that a batch can contain data from multiple
# channels, let's take a look at single_channel operations

# traverse the whole dataset, one channel at a time
data = bp.single_channel()

# the next for loop will raise an error since we cannot fit
# all observations for a single channel in memory, so we
# either increase max_memory or set
# force_complete_channel_batch to False

# for d in data:
#     print(d.shape)


# When force_complete_channel_batch is False, each batch does not necessarily
# correspond to all observations in the channel, the channel can be splitted
# in several batches (although every batch data is guaranteed to come from
# a single channel), in this case, every channel is splitted in two parts

                         channels=[0, 1, 2])

for d, ch in data:
    print(d.shape, 'Data from channel {}'.format(ch))


# finally, we can traverse a single channel in a temporal subset
data = bp.single_channel(from_time=100000, to_time=200000, channels=[0, 1, 2])
